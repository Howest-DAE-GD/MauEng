In this project, we use a right-handed 3D coordinate system with the following conventions:
X-axis: Represents the horizontal direction.
	Positive X moves to the right.
	Negative X moves to the left.

Y-axis: Represents the vertical direction (with Y-up convention).
	Positive Y moves upward.
	Negative Y moves downward.

Z-axis: Represents the depth direction.
	Positive Z moves forward (towards the camera's view).
	Negative Z moves backward (away from the camera's view).
